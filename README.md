# usno
A simple keyboard layout that extends the standard US keyboard layout by adding norwegian keys to the AltGr-layer. Suitable for norwegian programmers.

Inspired by other keyboard layouts like [nous](https://git.sr.ht/~jole/nous), [norwerty](https://github.com/tobiasvl/norwerty) and [Nansi](https://github.com/oeywil/Nansi).
